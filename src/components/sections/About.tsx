                Hi, I&apos;m Monwar â€” a Software Developer with a strong
                interest in building sleek, performant web and mobile
                applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recently completed my BSc in Computer Science with Software
                Development (with a Year in Industry) at the University of
                Liverpool. During my studies and 2 years of industrial
                experience, I worked on a range of real-world projects using
                modern tech like React, React Native, .NET, and Next.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                I&apos;m passionate about crafting smooth user experiences,
                learning new frameworks, and writing clean, maintainable code.
                Whether it&apos;s building dashboards, mobile apps, or
                full-stack platforms, I enjoy solving problems through code and
                bringing ideas to life. Let&apos;s build something great.
              </p>
